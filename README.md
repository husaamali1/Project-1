# Project-1
# Chicken Cross

Welcome to Chicken Cross, a fun and engaging game where your goal is to help a chicken navigate past various obstacles to safely cross the road. Developed as a solo project, this game challenges players to think quickly and move swiftly to avoid dangers and reach the destination.

## Project Duration

This project was developed from Monday, January 22nd, to Monday, January 29th. Working solo, I embarked on this incredible journey to build a game that not only functioned fully but also provided a playable and enjoyable experience for one player with auto-generated obstacles.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game's web interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the game's appearance.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and DOM manipulation, creating a dynamic and interactive gaming experience.

## Technical Requirements

The game meets the following technical requirements:
- Rendered in the browser without using HTML Canvas.
- Built on a grid using JavaScript for a structured layout.
- Logic for winning is designed, and the game visually displays which player won.
- Organised with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Adherence to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Deployed online for global access.

## Planning

The planning phase involved drawing wireframes on Excalidraw, which facilitated a clear vision for the app's design and functionality, streamlining the coding process.

## Development Process

### Day 1
- Began with sketching the game layout using Excalidraw.
- Created the game grid using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

### Day 2
- Implemented chicken movement using arrow keys and added obstacles that move within the grid.

### Day 3
- Focused on car functionalities, ensuring their continuous movement and resolving any encountered issues.

### Day 4
- Developed winning conditions and a life system, integrating 3 lives for the gameplay.

### Day 5
- Added start and reset buttons to control game initiation and reset functionalities.

### Day 6
- Performed bug checks and improved styling for a more cohesive and appealing game appearance.

## Key Wins

The implementation of car movement and game logic, especially the `moveCars` function, stands out as a significant achievement, enhancing the game's interactivity and fun.

## Challenges

Finding the perfect visual elements, such as the road image and life icons' placement, posed a challenge but was crucial for the game's aesthetic appeal.

## Key Learnings

- The importance of visual element selection for an immersive gaming experience.
- Effective color matching and alignment techniques.
- Patience and diligence in debugging for a seamless gameplay experience.

## Current Bugs

- Buttons and life icons placement require further refinement.
- The reset button sometimes unexpectedly triggers a Game Over alert.
